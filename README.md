Kaggle Careercon 2019: Intro to APIs tutorial

### Here are three questions we want to answer.

### What do we want our API to do?
What are we passing in to do that thing?
What are we getting back when we do that thing?

### For this example, our answers might look something like this.

We want our API to tell us where specific keywords appear in our text.
We are passing in a JSON with our text file.
Weâ€™re getting a JSON with our keyword matches and where they occur in the input text.
